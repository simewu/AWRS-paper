\section{Anti-Withholding Reward System}
\label{sec:awrs}

Our scheme called Anti-Withholding Reward System (AWRS) introduces greater incentives for block submission than the share submissions by introducing $\Gamma$ to control the pool's reward to the block submitter. 
In other words, $\Gamma$ fraction of the pool's winnings goes to the block submitter while $1-\Gamma$ is distributed according to the share submissions, i.e., proportional to the number of shares for each miners. 
Previously, $\Gamma$ is fixed at $\Gamma=0$ without AWRS. 
$\Gamma=1$ yields solo mining because the block submitter receives all the pool reward and the share submissions do not affect the reward distributions.

AWRS is effective against both FAW and BWH attacks. %and increases the resistance against withholding in general.
To show the effectiveness of our scheme, however, we focus on FAW attack rather than BWH attack
because FAW attack is the more advanced attack with greater attack/reward impact and can generalize BWH attack, as described in Section~\ref{subsec:faw_attack}.

AWRS is implemented on the mining pool manager %     also only requires changes/updates in the mining pool manager implementation 
because it only controls the reward distribution given out by the pool manager.
Since it does not require any changes in the miner implementations, it has a low implementation barrier and is backward-compatible, which has been identified as a major challenge in the practicality of implementing the security defenses on blockchain~\cite{b4,b11}.
